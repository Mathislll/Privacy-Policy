Privacy Policy
Last updated: 15/12/2025

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy applies to all games and applications (collectively, "the Services") developed by Loading Dreams ("we", "us", or "our").

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you play our games, and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protected, and disclosing that information.

2. Information We Collect
We have designed our Services with your privacy in mind.

Personal Information: We generally do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, physical address, phone number, or email address directly through our games.

Non-Personal Information: We (and our third-party service providers) may automatically collect certain non-personal technical information to ensure the proper functioning of the game. This includes:

Device type and model.

Operating system version.

System language.

General geographic location (country/city level, not precise location).

Gameplay data (e.g., scores, levels completed, game crash reports).

3. How We Use Your Information
Since we do not collect personal information directly, we do not use it for direct marketing or communication. We use the non-personal information collected to:

Provide and maintain our Services.

Improve game performance and fix bugs.

Display advertisements (which allow us to offer the game for free).

Analyze usage trends to develop better updates.

4. Third-Party Services (Ads & Analytics)
While we do not hold your data, we use trusted third-party services that may collect data to function. These services have their own privacy policies.

A. Advertising We use Unity Ads to display advertisements. Unity Ads may collect data regarding your device and your interaction with ads to provide personalized advertising relevant to your interests.

B. Analytics & Crash Reporting We use Google Firebase (formerly Fabric) and/or Google Analytics to understand how users interact with our games and to detect crash issues. This helps us fix technical problems.

5. Your Rights (GDPR & CCPA)
Depending on your location, you may have specific rights regarding your data:

GDPR (European Union): You have the right to access, rectify, or erase your personal data held by third-party processors. You can often manage your ad preferences directly within your device settings (Settings > Privacy > Ads).

CCPA (California): Residents of California have the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information. As we use third-party ad networks, you can opt-out of personalized ads via your device settings.

6. Children’s Privacy
Our Services are intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the age of digital consent in your region). If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly remove it.

For games labeled as "Family" or designed for children, we configure our third-party services (like Unity Ads) to filter age-appropriate content and limit data collection in compliance with COPPA and GDPR-K.

7. Data Security
We rely on administrative, physical, and electronic measures designed to protect your Non-Personal Information from unauthorized access. However, please be aware that no security measure is perfect or impenetrable.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
